# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Use whatever shell tmux was first started in, instead of the login shell

# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w

bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 1
bind > resize-pane -R 1

# this is the default in tmux already
